RMIRegistry:
  For server-side use:
    HashMap registry : mapping name to remote object stub and location

  Static: these are for client-side use
    lookup (String name, String registry_host)
      find and return remote object stub from registry host

    register (String name, RMIRemote object, String registry_host)
      register the remote object into the registry at the host

    unregister (String name, String registry_host) 
      unregister the remote object from the registry at the host

RMIRemote
  Interface
  boolean variable registered : tells if this object was registered

RMIRemoteStub


Process outline.

1) Client lookups object by name
      RMIRemote stub = RMIRegistry.lookup ("name", "host");

2) RMIRegistry at "host" returns the RMIRemote stub to client

3) Client calls method through stub
      stub.method (... args);

4) Stub marshalls object name, method name, and args[] and sends them to Server

5) Server unmarshalls method name and args[] and invokes the method on the object
